# Messaging-App
A chat app built using node.js framework of javascript.

Node.js is a platform built on the Chrome JavaScript runtime that can help you build fast, scalable network applications. 
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficientâ€”perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. In this project, I learned the topics such as npm, reading and writing files, and Node.js frameworks.
